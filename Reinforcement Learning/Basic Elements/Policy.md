- A policy defines the learning agentâ€™s way of behaving at a given time
- It is a mapping from perceived states of the environment to **actions** to be taken when in those states
- It is a function with different nature in different setups, e.g.:
	- a simple lookup table
	- may be stochastic specifying the probability of each action
- It is the core of a reinforcement learning **agent** $\rightarrow$ it alone is sufficient to determine **behavior**
