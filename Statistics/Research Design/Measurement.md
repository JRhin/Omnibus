- The measurements $\iff$ quantification, i.e. a mapping from the set of humans set observations $\mathcal{H}$ to a general set of measures $\mathcal{M}$
  $$q:\mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{M}$$

>The nature of the measurement set $\mathcal{M}$ defines the [[Scale]] of the measurement $q$.

#### Characteristic of a measurement:
- **[[Scale]]**
- **[[Reliability]]**
- **[[Validity]]**
