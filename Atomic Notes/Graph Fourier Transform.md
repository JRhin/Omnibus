Given a [[Atomic Notes/Graph Shift Operator]] $S=UAU^H$, the graph Fourier transform $\mathcal{GFT}(\cdot)$ is defined as:
$$
\mathcal{GFT}(x)=U^Hx
$$
Where $U^H$ is the Hermitian of $U$, which is the matrix of the eigenvectors of $S$.
Usually the shift operator used is the [[Graph Laplacian|laplacian]] $L$ associated to the graph.
