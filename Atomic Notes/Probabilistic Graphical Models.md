When we refer to probabilistic graphical models we consider a graph signal as a random variable. In this scenario a graph represents the dependencies of the random variables. So...

Given a graph $G=(V,\mathcal{E})$ such that:
- $V$ are the random variables.
- $\mathcal{E}$ encode statistical dependencies.

The are two types of probabilistic graphical models:
- [[Markov Networks]]: undirected graphs that capture conditional statistical dependencies.
- [[Bayes Network]]: directed graphs that capture causality.
