- A graph is a widely used mathematical structure designed to represent **pairwise interactions** between entities and serves as a fundamental example of topological space. 
- It consists of a set of *nodes*, $\mathcal{V}$, and *edges*, $\mathcal{E}$ $\implies$ getting a graph $\mathcal{G(V,E)}$
- It can be of two types:
	- **directed**, if each edge $(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}$ has an associated direction
	- **undirected**, otherwise

#### Example of directed graph

In this case the graph $\mathcal{G(V,E)}$ is defined by:
- $\mathcal{V}=\{0,1,2,3,4\}$
- $\mathcal{E}=\{(0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,4), (2,3), (3,4)\}$

>A graph is structure representing a set of objects (nodes) and the pairwise relations between these objects (edges). It is a basic topological domain and, as such, it can be fully described by its related [[Graph Algebraic Operators]].
