The notion of ceteris paribus plays an important role in causal analysis, and consists in considering all the other (relevant) factors fixed/constant when focusing on a particular variable, during a step of our analysis.

>[!tip] Example
>In analyzing consumer demand, we are interested in knowing the effect of changing the price of a good on its quantity demanded, while holding all other factors — such as income, prices of other goods, and individual tastes — **fixed**. 

>[!warning] 
>From the above example, if other factors are not held fixed, then we **cannot know the causal effect** of a price change on quantity demanded.

>[!info] In practice...
>...the most economic questions are ceteris paribus by nature and we'll need some special attention for this important assumption, in particular when *interpreting the causal meaning of the parameters* of econometric models.
