It consists in the development of *statistical methods* for:
- estimating economic relationships
- testing economic theories
- evaluating and implementing government and business policy

>Economic tools, such as the **utility maximization framework**, to explain behaviors that may appear to be noneconomic in nature: e.g. [Beckerâ€™s economic model of criminal behavior](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/259394).

>[!danger] Important
>Econometrics is NOT STRICTLY useful for forecasting economic indicators, but enables the study of causal relations!

**In practice:**
The main goal is to infer if some variables have a causal effect on other variables.
To do this we use an [[Empirical Analysis]] applied on data of different nature such as:
- [[Cross-Sectional Data]]
- [[Pooled Cross-Sectional Data]]
- [[Time Series]]
- [[Panel Data]]

>[!warning]
>An important assumption that we'll consider in pursuing our empirical analysis will be the [[Ceteris Paribus Assumption]]
