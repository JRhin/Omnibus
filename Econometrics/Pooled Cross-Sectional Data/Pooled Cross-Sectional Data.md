This type of data comes from the independently pooling cross-sectional data, by sampling randomly from a large population at different points in time.

>[!info] Example
>In each year we draw a random sample on hourly wages, education, experience, and so on from working people in USA.

Main comparisons:
- the main difference with simple [[Cross-Sectional Data]] is that sampling from population over time may lead to observations that are not identically distributed ([[Distribution Shift]]). Thus we have **independent sampling** over time
- the main difference with [[Panel Data]] is that the population could actually change over time while Panel Data focus on the observation of the same population (same samples) across different periods of time
