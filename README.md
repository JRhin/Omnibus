# The Omnibus

### TODO
- [ ] Add a tag to each markdown for each subdirectory in its path, e.g. add tags `#econometrics`, `#cross-sectional-data`, `#endogeneity`, `#instrumental-variables` to the md file having path `Econometrics\Cross-Sectional_Data\Endogeneity\Instrumental_Variables`
- [ ] Add a **author tag** (or something similar) to the md file representing the author of the md file itself (in this way we can filter notes by authors). It would be cool to possibly have multiple authors on the same md based on who both modified or created the file.
- [ ] solve the image path issue in order to display all the images also in the github/web version of the Omnibus
- [ ]  Add bibliography to each md file (maybe adding a *bibtex* file the related md directory)
- [ ]  Add some simple (CSS?) script for easily formatting images in mds
- [ ] Write a `Contributions.md` to explain how to contribute to this repository
- [ ] (OPT) Add a `Papers` section?
