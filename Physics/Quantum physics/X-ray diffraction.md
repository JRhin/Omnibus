### Diffraction grating

**Description**:
1. Wave fronts pass through a barrier that has many slits and then recombine.
2. interference maxima corresponding to different wavelengths appear at different angles $\theta$ according to:
$$
d\sin\theta=n\lambda 
$$
	where: 
	$d$ is the slit spacing and 
	$n$ is the order number of the maximum

**Advantages of diffraction grating**:
It enables superior resolution 
$\implies$ very good separation of wavelengths that are close to one another 
$\implies$ useful device for measuring wavelengths

**Main issue of diffraction grating**:
In order to get reasonable values of the angle $\theta$
$\iff$ we must have $d$ of the order of a few times the wavelength
$\iff$ for X rays with a wavelength of the order of 0.1 nm, we would need a grating in with slits less than 1 nm apart
$\iff$ roughly the same as the spacing between the atoms of most materials

**Solution**:
Laue and Bragg proposed to ==use atoms themselves as a diffraction grating==!


### Crystal diffraction experiment

**Description**:
1. Consider a two-dimensional slice of crystal
2. The X rays are reflected from individual atoms in all directions
3. In only one direction will the scattered “wavelets” *constructively* interfere to produce a reflected beam
4. We can regard the reflection as occurring from a plane drawn through the row of atoms
5. Suppose the rows of atoms are a distance $d$ apart in the crystal
6. Then a portion of the beam is reflected from the front plane, and a portion is reflected from the second plane, and so forth...
7. The wave fronts of the beam reflected from the second plane lag behind those reflected from the front plane, because the wave reflected from the second plane must travel an additional distance of $2d\sin\theta$ ($\theta$: angle of incidence as measured from the face of the crystal)
8. If this path difference is a **whole number of wavelengths**, the reflected beams interfere constructively and give an intensity maximum.
9. This relation is expressed by the **Bragg's law**:
$$
2d\sin\theta=n\lambda\quad n=1,2,3,\ldots 
$$

**More complex setup**:
1. there are many possible reflecting planes each with a different value of $\theta$ and $d$
2. interference pattern:
	- beam of X rays of a single wavelength $\implies$ difficult to find the proper angle and set of planes to observe the interference
	- beam of X rays of a continuous range of wavelengths
	  $\implies$ for each $d_{i}$ and $\theta_{i}$ interference will occur for a certain wavelength $\lambda_{i}$
	  $\implies$ a pattern of interference maxima appearing at different angles of reflection
	  $\implies$ pattern of interference maxima depends on the spacing and the type of arrangement of the atoms in the crystal
	  $\implies$ an example: *Laue patterns*
