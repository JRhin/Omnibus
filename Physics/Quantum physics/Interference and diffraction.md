### Principle of superposition

Allows two waves to meet at a point
- to cause a combined disturbance at the point (at the point that might be greater or less than the disturbance produced by either wave alone)
- to emerge from the point of “collision” with all of the properties of each wave totally unchanged

This special property leads to two main phenomena:
- **interference**
- **diffraction**

### Young's double slit experiment

**Description**:
1. The plane wave fronts are diffracted by each of the slits
2. The light passing through each slit covers a much larger area on the screen than the geometric shadow of the slit
3. This causes the light from the two slits to overlap on the screen, producing the **interference**:
	- when wave crest passing through one slit arrives at exactly the same time as the previous wave crest that passed through the other slit
	  $\implies$ the intensity is at maximum
	  $\implies$ bright regions on the screen
	  $\implies$ **constructive interference**
	- when the crest of the wave from one slit to arrive at a point on the screen simultaneously with the trough (valley) of the wave from the other slit
	  $\implies$ the two waves cancel
	  $\implies$ dark regions on the screen
	  $\implies$ **destructive interference**

**Interference occurrence conditions**:
- **constructive interference** $\iff$ the difference between $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ be an integral number of wavelengths:
$$|X_1-X_2|=n\lambda\quad n=0,1,2,\ldots$$
- **destructive interference** $\iff$ the difference between $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are s.t. the phase of one wave differs from the other by one-half cycle, or by one and one-half cycles, two and one-half cycles, and so forth:
$$
|X_1-X_2|=\frac{1}{2}\lambda,\frac{3}{2}\lambda,\frac{5}{2}\lambda,\ldots=(n+\frac{1}{2})\lambda\quad n=0,1,2,\ldots 
$$

We can also simply find the locations on the screen where the interference maxima occur with a simple procedure getting:
$$
y_n=n\frac{\lambda D}d
$$
