**Diffraction setup**:
- light of wavelength $\lambda$ incident on a slit of width $a$
- the diffraction minima (see [[Interference and diffraction]] for more info) are located at angles given by:
$$
a\sin\theta=n\lambda\quad n=1,2,3,\ldots 
$$
	on either side of the central maximum.
- most of the light intensity falls in the central maximum

**Diffraction grating for electrons**:
- assume a beam of electrons is accelerated from rest through a potential difference $\Delta V$
- they *nonrelativistic* kinetic energy and momentum:
$$
\begin{align}
K&=e\Delta V \\
p&=\sqrt{2mK}
\end{align}
$$
- wave mechanics $\implies$electrons as a wave of wavelength $\lambda=h /p$
- the beam strikes a crystal and the scattered beam is given in the figure above
- result pretty similar to the one obtained for [[X-ray diffraction]] $\implies$ ==electrons behave like a wave==


### Davisson & Gremer study on electron diffraction (Bell labs)

**Goal**:
Verify the **de Broglie hypothesis**

![[Pasted image 20240823160843.png|200]]

**Setup**:
1. A beam of electrons from a heated filament is accelerated through a potential difference $\Delta V$
2. After passing through a small aperture, the beam strikes a single crystal of nickel
3. Electrons are scattered in all directions by the atoms of the crystal, some of them striking a detector
4. The detector can be moved to any angle φ relative to the incident beam
   $\implies$ measuring the intensity of the electron beam scattered at that angle

**Result**:
1. When the accelerating voltage is of $54V$, they very an intense reflection beam at an angle of $\phi=50°$

2. the electrons were of low energy 
   $\implies$they did not penetrate very far into the crystal
   $\implies$ sufficient to consider the diffraction to take place in the plane of atoms on the surface

3. The maxima for a diffraction grating occur at angles $\phi$ s.t.:
$$
d\sin\phi=n\lambda\quad n=1,2,3,\ldots 
$$
4. Consider:
   - $\phi=50°$ $\rightarrow$ diffraction angle
   - $\Delta V = 54V$ $\rightarrow$ electron acceleration
   - $d=0.215$ nm $\rightarrow$ spacing between atoms of nickel
   - set $n=1$
   - $\Delta V=54V$ $\implies$ $K=54$ eV
   - $p=\sqrt{ 2mK }$
5. It is easy to verify that the wavelength obtained from diffraction theory is the same that the one from the de Broglie hypothesis, i.e.:
$$
\lambda=d\sin \phi=\frac{h}{p} = 0.165 \: \text{nm}
$$

>[!tip] Main conclusion
>The wave nature of particles is not exclusive to electrons; any particle with momentum $p$ has **de Broglie wavelength** $h/p$.
