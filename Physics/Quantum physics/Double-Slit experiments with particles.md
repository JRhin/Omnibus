**Setup**:
- the experiment is the once introduced by Young in 1801 (see notes on [[Interference and diffraction]])
- electrons from a hot filament were accelerated through $50$ kV $\implies$ $\lambda=5.4$ pm
- then passed through a double slit of separation $2.0$ μm and width $0.5$ μm
- the resulting pattern is similar to the once obtained for light

**Results**:
1. The resulting $\lambda$ empirically coincides with the de Broglie wavelength (as in the [[Particle diffraction]] experiment)
2. These experiments are not restricted to any particular type of particle or to any particular type of observation. They are examples of a general phenomenon, the **wave nature of particles**

**Evidence or result 2**:

>[!info] Practical use cases
>1. Neutron diffraction gives detailed information on the structure of solid crystals and of complex molecules
>2. The electron microscope uses electron waves to illuminate and form an image of objects; because the wavelength can be made thousands of times smaller than that of visible light, it is possible to resolve and observe small details that are not observable with visible light

### Through Which Slit Does the Particle Pass?

**Key point**:
If we could track each particle as it passed through one slit or the other, the result would no longer be an interference pattern on the screen. We would observe a pattern with “hits” in front of each slit, but no interference fringes.

**Motivation**:
- the classical particle $\implies$ must pass through one slit or the other
- a wave$\implies$ can reveal interference, which depends on parts of the wavefront passing through both slits and then recombining.
$\implies$ When we ask through which slit the particle passed, we are investigating only the particle aspects of its behavior, and we cannot observe its wave nature (the interference pattern). Conversely, when we study the wave nature, we cannot simultaneously observe the particle nature.

>[!tip] Principle of complementarity
>1. The complete description of a photon or a particle such as an electron cannot be made in terms of only particle properties or only wave properties, but that both aspects of its behavior must be considered
>2. The particle and wave natures cannot be observed simultaneously, and the type of behavior that we observe depends on the kind of experiment we are doing

>[!danger] Heisenberg Uncertainty Relationship
>The principle of complementarity is strictly related to the concept of [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Relationships]].
