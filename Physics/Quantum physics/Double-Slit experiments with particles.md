**Setup**:
- the experiment is the once introduced by Young in 1801 (see notes on [[Interference and diffraction]])
- electrons from a hot filament were accelerated through $50$ kV $\implies$ $\lambda=5.4$ pm
- then passed through a double slit of separation $2.0$ μm and width $0.5$ μm
- the resulting pattern is similar to the once obtained for light

**Results**:
1. The resulting $\lambda$ empirically coincides with the de Broglie wavelength (as in the [[Particle diffraction]] experiment)
2. These experiments are not restricted to any particular type of particle or to any particular type of observation. They are examples of a general phenomenon, the **wave nature of particles**

**Evidence or result 2**:

>[!info] Practical use cases
>1. Neutron diffraction gives detailed information on the structure of solid crystals and of complex molecules
>2. The electron microscope uses electron waves to illuminate and form an image of objects; because the wavelength can be made thousands of times smaller than that of visible light, it is possible to resolve and observe small details that are not observable with visible light
