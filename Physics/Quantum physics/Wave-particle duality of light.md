**Key point**:
Light has this dichotomic aspect:
- it was usually regarded as a *wave* phenomenon since it shows inference and diffraction behaviours, typical of **[[Electromagnetic wave]]s**
- it has *particle* properties since in some experiments, instead of spreading its energy smoothly over a wave front, the energy is concentrated in particle-like bundles $\rightarrow$ photons.

**Photon**:
A photon is a discrete bundle (quantum) of electromagnetic energy.

## Quantum theory of light

Let's unfold this dualism:
- In some experiments the light shows a wave behaviour such as in **[[Interference and diffraction]]** of light waves.
- BUT there are three main experiments that cannot be explained by the wave theory of light:
	- the [[Photoelectric effect]]
	- the [[Thermal radiation]]
	- the [[Compton effect]]

| the energy carried by a particle is confined to a small region of space. | A wave distributes its energy over space in its wavefronts |
| We want too specify its location                                         | It is not easy to localize a wave                          |

### De Broglie's hypothesis

**Issue**:
- consider the relativistic equations for a particle:
$$
\begin{align}
E&= hf \\
p&=\frac{h}{\lambda}
\end{align}
$$
- We are not sure whether $E$ should be the kinetic energy, total energy, or total relativistic energy (all, of course, are identical for light).

**Hypothesis**:
Associated with ==any material particle== moving with momentum $p$ there is a wave of wavelength $\lambda$, related to $p$ according to:
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$
where:
- $h$ $\rightarrow$ Planck's constant
- $\lambda$ $\rightarrow$ de Broglie wavelength

>[!danger] In practice
>Because of the smallness of h, only for particles of atomic or nuclear size will the wave behavior be observable!

>[!tip] Important features
>1. *What sort of wave is it that has this de Broglie wavelength?*
>   Associated with the particle as it moves, there is a **de Broglie wave** of wavelength $\lambda$, which shows itself when a wave-type experiment (such as diffraction) is performed on it. The outcome of the wave-type experiment depends on this wavelength.
>2. *Why is in practice difficult to observe the de Broglie wavelength?*
>   - consider the double-slit experiment
>   - given $D$ $\rightarrow$ the slit-to-screen distance
>   - given $d$ $\rightarrow$ the slit separation 
>   - the spacing between adjacent fringes is $\Delta y=\lambda D /d$
>   $\implies$ There is no experiment that can be done to reveal the wave nature of macroscopic (laboratory-sized) objects.

Evidence of this theoretical hypothesis is given by two famous type of experiments:
1. the [[Particle diffraction]] experiment
2. the [[Double-Slit experiments with particles]]
